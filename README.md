# Setup_script
Just a small script I made for myself to set up all my cpp exercises

Build.sh 5 for exemple will create 5 folders in your current working directory starting from ex00
to ex00 to ex04

what you can do :
- you might have to give the appropriate rights to the script and to the files
- most likely make an alias with the path of the script in .zshrc
(vim .zshrc in home, then writes alias BUILD="/PATH_TO_SCRIPT/build.sh", and now I can type BUILD anywhere to set up my folders !)

Feel free to change the files with your own Makefile or your own templates
